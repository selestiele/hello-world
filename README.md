# hello-world
Just another repository

I am a web design/development student looking at starting a career in front-end web development. I have dabbled in Wordpress theme development in the past, and over the last few years I have been a freelance digital artist. Coding has always been an interest of mine, but it wasn't until recently that I decided to make a career out of it.
